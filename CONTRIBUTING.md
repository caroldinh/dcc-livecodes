# How to contribute
The gist of it is:
1. You will make your changes in your own fork (copy) of the repository.
2. You will make a pull request to add the changes in your fork to the base repository.
3. Your peers will review your code and I will merge your changes when we are ready!

## On commit messages
Many developers use a commit message convention called ["Conventional Commits."](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) For this repository, just make sure your message is brief and clear. Same with pull request messages. It may feel redundant with your commit messages, but remember that when you are contributing to more complicated codebases, other developers may not have as clear a context for what you are adding (whereas we are all sitting in a workshop doing the same thing!).

## Step-by-step guide
1. Fork the [base repository](https://github.com/caroldinh/dcc-livecodes/).
