# About my code

I made this piece to demonstrate Hydra for the workshop. I created it by referencing the documents and throwing together some functions I thought would look cool together. It ends up looking very spacey. I call it "Nebulous."   

I am also uploading an example Hydra file generated from one of the random examples online.
